All potential Clients will have a chance to “pitch” their project to the class in a lightning style two minute presentation.</p>

                          <p>A client plays two primary roles - defining the problem, and verifying that the end result solves it. Specify, What problem are you trying to solve?  Why is it a problem?  What features are necessary to solve that problem? will be heavily influenced by your input.  That doesn’t mean that you need to come armed with diagrams, flowcharts, drawings, and a complete vision (although we won’t turn any of that away). What you need to come with is a vision of what you want to do and why. The team will work with you to help determine how that can be achieved, and will probably even have good ideas of their own!

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                          <p>No! Most stakeholders in industry projects are not. You don’t need to know how to code, or how to design a mobile app, or what an API is - that’s the team’s job.  That doesn’t preclude technical clients; if you are an industry partner proposing a project that will integrate with other work that you are doing, that’s great.</p>

                        <div class="accordion-content">
                          <p>Probably not.  Depending on your project, and where you want it to run and how you want it to be available afterwards, there may be costs related to hosting or distributing the final result, but there are no costs related to the project development itself.  If, for example, you want an iPhone app, Apple charges to have them deployed to the app store; this would be a cost you need to cover if you want your project deployed to the app store.

If you’re an entrepreneur, you already understand the idea of the Minimum Viable Product.  What features mean that you can actually use the project to start achieving the goals in the vision?  Which ones will make things better, but aren’t mission critical?</p>

                    <p>That depends on the project, and your resources.  If you just want the source code, that’s easy. If you want to have it deployed into your production environment, that can be part of the project, but it is important that you specify that early so that the team can plan for deployment time (and you’ll need to work with them to provide the appropriate access).

It is also possible that you are happy with the project, but think of another 10 features that you would just love to have - and that’s OK, you can pitch a phase 2 in a future semester if you want!</p>
